# AntFarmReactNative

This project written on React Native. 

The application was created to connect RPi to the WIFI network or to change it. The Android app was created using the React Native framework. Additional libraries were also used such as: Easy bluetooth classic, NativeBase, React Navigation.
Easy bluetooth classic - a library that is designed to interact with devices via Bluetooth. Its key features are: Search for Bluetooth devices, connect to them, receive and transfer data. To use it, you need Android version not lower than 4.1 and React Native not lower than 0.40.0.
NativeBase is a mobile application development system that allows developers to use React Native to create their own mobile applications running on major mobile platforms - Apple iOS and Google Android. Stack of application components is built using its own components of the interface. NativeBase focuses specifically on the look and feel of the interface of the application [27].
React Navigation extends the React Native framework. His main goal is to improve navigation. It is completely written in javascript.
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real mobile apps for iOS and Android. It is based on the Facebook ReactJS library for creating user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser - aimed at mobile platforms. Web developers can now write mobile apps that look and function as "native". Since most code can be used across platforms, React Native makes it easier to design both for Android and iOS [26].
The components of the application are in AntFarmReactNative / src /. The MainScreen.js main page (AntFarmReactNative / src / screens / main /) includes the following components: Bluetooth device scan key, device connection, change of WiFi networks, network key and password password, additional keys - «Learn IP» the RPi address, and the "Update list" of the networks.
