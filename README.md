./gradlew clean
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

NativeBase is a mobile application development system that allows developers to use React Native to create their own mobile applications running on major mobile platforms - Apple iOS and Google Android. Stack of application components is built using its own components of the interface. NativeBase focuses specifically on the look and feel of the interface of the application.

React Navigation extends the React Native framework. His main goal is to improve navigation. It is completely written in javascript.

React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real mobile apps for iOS and Android. It is based on the Facebook ReactJS library for creating user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser - aimed at mobile platforms. Web developers can now write mobile apps that look and function as "native". Since most code can be used across platforms, React Native makes it easier to design both for Android and iOS [26].

The components of the application are in AntFarmReactNative / src /.
